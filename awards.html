  <img src="img/angouleme.jpg"><p>I love things that age well - things that don't date, that stand the test of time and that become living examples of the absolute best. The important thing is to take your time and not get stressed. The market is like a language, and you have to be able to understand what they're saying. Clothes mean nothing until someone lives in them. The market is like a language, and you have to be able to understand what they're saying.</p>

  <img src="img/fake.jpg"><p>Vanity is the healthiest thing in life. Being one step ahead of a fashion trend is not so important to me. What matters is to always forge ahead. You have a more interesting life if you wear impressive clothes. It's useless to send models out on the runway to cry. I never like to think that I design for a particular person. I design for the woman I wanted to be, the woman I used to be, and - to some degree - the woman I'm still a little piece of.</p>
</div>

<div class="left">
  <img src="img/mock.jpg"><p>I sometimes feel that a pattern is almost a fashion statement in itself. Design is a constant challenge to balance comfort with luxe, the practical with the desirable. You have to be luxurious nude. It's difficult to move in the nude in front of a mirror. It's much easier to move when you're dressed. But if you can walk around in the nude easily in front of your man, if you can be luxurious in the nude, then you've really got it. I've treated the waistcoat as if it were a corset, so that it becomes the first layer in the process of putting clothes on the body. There is constant motion between layering and revealing. Fashion to me has become very disposable; I wanted to get back to craft, to clothes that could last.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
  <img src="img/quadshow.jpg"><p>There has to be a balance between your mental satisfaction and the financial needs of your company. I have a fantastic relationship with money. I use it to buy my freedom. What I hate is nasty, ugly people. I think the idea of mixing luxury and mass-market fashion is very modern, very now - no one wears head-to-toe designer anymore. Instead of buying six things, one thing that you really like. Don't keep buying just for the sake of it.</p>
</div>

<div class="left">
  <img src="img/scary.jpg"><p>Design and style should work toward making you look good and feel good without a lot of effort so you can get on with the things that matter. Fashion fades, only style remains the same. Grunge is a hippied romantic version of punk. It should be natural, and that's how I like women to look. I like them to feel comfortable and look organic. My learning process is by eye alone; it's not at all scientific.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
  <img src="img/telly.jpg"><p>I can't get sucked into that celebrity thing, because I think it's just crass. I never like to think that I design for a particular person. I design for the woman I wanted to be, the woman I used to be, and - to some degree - the woman I'm still a little piece of. Money doesn't buy elegance. You can take an inexpensive sheath, add a pretty scarf, gray shoes, and a wonderful bag, and it will always be elegant. I'm an accomplice to helping women get what they want. My shows are about the complete woman who swallows it all. It's a question of survival.</p>
</div>

<div class="left">
  <img src="img/wings.jpg"><p>There is always an emotional element to anything that you make. It pains me physically to see a woman victimized, rendered pathetic, by fashion. Today, I'm very happy about myself, because I realized my dreams. I learned how to understand what people want. I truly believe that philanthropy and commerce can work together. First I made a dress because I was pregnant and I wanted to be the most beautiful pregnant woman. Then I made a sweater because I wanted to have one that wasn't like anyone else's.</p>
